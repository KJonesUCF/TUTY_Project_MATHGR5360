### Part 1: Interactive Statistical Analysis using R


After some quick visualizations of our two datasets TU/TY, we set up two statistical tests:

- Push-response analysis
- Andrew Lo's variance ratio

The interactive application is deployed on [shinyapps.io](https://virgile-mison-columbia.shinyapps.io/statistical_analysis_of_tuty/).


More to come.
